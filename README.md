# Automatic Ripping Machine (ARM)

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine)

## Overview

Insert an optical disc (Blu-Ray, DVD, CD) and checks to see if it's audio, video (Movie or TV), or data, then rips it.

See: https://b3n.org/automatic-ripping-machine


## Features

- Detects insertion of disc using udev
- Determines disc type...
  - If video (Blu-Ray or DVD)
    - Retrieve title from disc or Windows Media MetaServices API to name the folder "movie title (year)" so that Plex or Emby can pick it up
    - Determine if video is Movie or TV using OMDb API
    - Rip using MakeMKV (can rip all features or main feature)
    - Eject disc and queue up Handbrake transcoding when done
    - Transcoding jobs are asynchronusly batched from ripping
    - Send notification when done via IFTTT or Pushbullet
  - If audio (CD) - rip using abcde
  - If data (Blu-Ray, DVD, or CD) - make an ISO backup
- Headless, designed to be run from a server
- Can rip from multiple-optical drives in parallel


## Requirements

- Ubuntu Server 16.04 (should work with other Linux distros)
- One or more optical drives to rip Blu-Rays, DVDs, and CDs
- Lots of drive space (I suggest using a NAS like FreeNAS) to store your movies

## Install

If you have a  new DVD drive that you haven't used before, some require setting the region before they can play anything.  Be aware most DVD players only let you change the region a handful (4 or 5?) of times then lockout any further changes.  If your region is already set or you have a region free DVD drive you can skip this step.

    sudo apt-get install regionset
    sudo regionset /dev/sr0

Install...    

    sudo apt-get install git
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:heyarje/makemkv-beta
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:stebbins/handbrake-releases
    sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mc3man/xerus-media
    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install makemkv-bin makemkv-oss
    sudo apt install handbrake-cli libavcodec-extra
    sudo apt install abcde flac imagemagick glyrc cdparanoia
    sudo apt install at
    sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
    sudo apt-get install libdvd-pkg
    sudo dpkg-reconfigure libdvd-pkg
    sudo su
    cd /opt
    git clone https://github.com/automatic-ripping-machine/automatic-ripping-machine.git arm
    cd arm
    pip3 install -r requirements.txt
    ln -s /opt/arm/51-automedia.rules /lib/udev/rules.d/
    ln -s /opt/arm/.abcde.conf /root/
    cp /opt/arm/arm@.service /etc/systemd/system/
    cp config.sample config

- Edit your "config" file to determine what options you'd like to use
- To rip Blu-Rays after the MakeMKV trial is up you will need to purchase a license key or while MakeMKV is in BETA you can get a free key (which you will need to update from time to time) here:  https://www.makemkv.com/forum2/viewtopic.php?f=5&t=1053 and create /root/.MakeMKV/settings.conf with the contents:

        app_Key = "insertlicensekeyhere"


Optionally if you want something more stable than master you can download the latest release from the releases page.

## Automated virtual machine setup
As an alternative to manual installation, a virtual machine can be setup in an automated fashion. This requires [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html) and [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) in addition to [git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to be installed on the host machine.

For Ubuntu run the following:

    sudo apt install vagrant virtualbox

To setup the virtual machine (for any OS)

    git clone https://github.com/ahnooie/automatic-ripping-machine.git arm
    cd arm

Copy config.sample to config and configure as desired. The `arm` directory you just created will be mounted to `/vagrant/` in the virtual machine, so that can be used as a base path to easily access the ripped files. So at a minimum, it's recommended to change the ARMPATH, RAWPATH and MEDIA_DIR settings to start with `/vagrant/`. You can also use the CIFS variables to mount a Windows share where movies are saved. It's recommended to only use it for the MEDIA_DIR setting to avoid network latency when ripping.

With the config in place, start the machine. It's also created and provisioned (set up), which takes a long time.

    vagrant up

When it's done, stop the machine.

    vagrant halt

Open the VirtualBox program and configure the virtual machine to access your physical DVD/Blu-ray drive(s). Then start the machine again.

    vagrant up

## Usage

- Insert disc
- Wait for disc to eject
- Repeat

## Troubleshooting

Check /opt/arm/log to see if you can find where the script failed.  If you need any help feel free to open an issue.
